<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the spring of 2019, I wrote some R code for a shiny application that would display the draft results of my auction draft. My motivation was to get better at using Shiny which I used in a prior group project at UIUC.
Along with using the shiny application as a part of my application for an R Studio internship that spring. Also I wanted to see if any of my competitors had tendencies to over pay for certain players.
However; I didnâ€™t get the opportunity to actually host the application on the internet and get people to use the application so this blog entry was a great opportunity to do just that.</p>
